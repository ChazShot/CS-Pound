Ver. ***1.1***

Using some async code trickery I have created the Remind Me command! Combining it together with the **,time** command, now you can technically have the bot ping you a few minutes before the pound opens!

Changelog:
* Added **,remindme** command

## Command Usage
```
,remindme <Xh|Xm|Xs>
```
